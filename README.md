# Project Overview
This project aims to build a Heart Disease Prediction system using Machine Learning Supervised learning Model - Logistic Regression.  The model predicts based on the given attributes of a patient, whether that particular person has heart disease or not

# Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the multivariate type of dataset "heart_disease_data" file.


# Tools
	• Excel CSV
 	• Google Colab
  • Following dependencies/libraries were imported:
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  * from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
  * from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
  
# Steps involved

* Import of required libraries
* Checking the number of missing values
* checking the distribution of  variable 'target' 
* Separating the data into features and Target
* Splitting the data into training and test data
* Model training using a Supervised learning algorithm (Logistic regression)
* Model evaluation using accuracy score
* Building a Predictive system with our trained model


# Results
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
* Accuracy on Training data:  0.8512396694214877
* Accuracy score on Test Data:  0.819672131147541
* The model build was able to correctly recognize the presence of heart disease with custom data
